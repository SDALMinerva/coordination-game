    Are you a person who is generally willing to take risks, or do you try to avoid taking risks? 
    Please indicate your answer on a scale from 1 to 10, where a 1 means “not at all willing to take risks”, and a 10 means “very willing to take risks”.

    <strong>2. You will be given hypothetical coin toss scenarios in the table below.</strong><br> 
    Each row corresponds to a different scenario.
    <em>For each of these scenarios, you must decide whether you want the coin toss or not.</em>  
    If you choose to toss the coin <strong>(YES Coin Toss)</strong>, you would get $200 if heads or $0 if tails. 
    If you choose not to toss the coin <strong>(NO Coin Toss)</strong>, you would receive a sure payment amount listed 
    in the column <strong>(NO Coin Toss)</strong> for each scenario. The amount for NO Coin Toss is different in each scenario. 
    Please indicate your coin toss choice (YES or NO) for each of the scenarios.

    The following questions count toward your final payment score. 
    When you submit answers to these questions, we will evaluate the outcome of the scenario according the probability given. 
    Your earnings in each scenario will be added to your total earnings in this experiment.
    The following questions will add to your final earnings. You can earn <strong>up to $3</strong> based on your choice and chance. 
    After you submit your answers to these questions, one of them will be randomly chosen and its outcome will determine your earning. 
    In these questions, we will use experimental points and they will be converted to cash with the following conversion rate: 1 experimental point = 0.005$
    </h5>    
    
    <p class=""><strong>3. Consider this scenario:</strong><br> 
    Suppose you have <strong>200 experimental points</strong> that you can choose to keep or invest in a risky project.

    <ol>
        <li>Money that is not invested in the risky project is yours to keep.</li> 
        <li>The risky project has a <strong>40% chance of success</strong>. If the project is successful, you will receive <strong>3 times<strong> the amount you chose to invest.</li> 
        <li>If the project is unsuccessful, you will lose the amount invested.</li>    
    </ol>
    <p>Please choose a percentage of points that you feel comfortable with investing in the risky project.<br>

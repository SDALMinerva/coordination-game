Each question below addresses a different scenario in a particular round of a game. 
Each circle represents a player in the game. 
In each figure, two circles that are connected with a line mean that they are friends. 
A circle that is not colored means that the player has not yet made a decision in the game. 
A <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">red</span> circle means that the player has chosen <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">not participate</span> in that round. 
A <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">green</span> circle means that the player has chosen <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">participate</span> in that round.

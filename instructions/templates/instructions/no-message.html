<h4>Participation Decision:</h4>

    <p>
	As mentioned above, your earnings depend on your decision to participate and othersâ€™ decisions to participate. 
	The screen below shows the decision making area. 
	Each player in the group must decide whether to participate or not participate in the group event for this round. 
	After making your participation decision for the round, a new round will start.
    </p>

    <p> 
	After you play all the rounds, at the end of the experiment, we will choose a random round and you will be paid based on the results of that round. 
	Because each round has the same chance of being chosen for payment, you should pay careful attention to each round.

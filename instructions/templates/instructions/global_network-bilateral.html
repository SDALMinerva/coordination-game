<h4>The Network:</h4>

    <p> 
	<strong>The network</strong> represents how people are connected in your group. 
	In each round, you will be connected to some or all of the other people in your group. 
	They will be called <strong>Your friends</strong>. 
	You will see the thresholds of your friends on your page. 
	You will also see a list of all of the people (including you) in <strong>Your group</strong>.
    </p>

    <p> 
        All of the five people in your group will be connected to some or all of the other people in the group, and can view the thresholds of their friends. 
	You (and everyone else) can observe the connections between people in your group in the network box.
    </p>

    <p> 
	The screen below shows an example of the network you may see in a round; the gray line between two avatars means that they are friends. 
	You will also see the list of your friends, and a list of all the players in your group. Note that you will be assigned to a new group in each round. 
	The shape of the network may or may not be the same in each round.
    </p>

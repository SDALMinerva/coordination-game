<li>There are 15 rounds in the experiment.</li>

<li>Each round is independent from the other: whatever happens in a round does not affect the next round.</li>

<li>In each round, you will be assigned to a new group of 5 players (including you).</li>

<li>In each round, every player will be assigned a new avatar and a new threshold.</li>

<li>Your earnings in a round depend on your threshold, your participation decision, and the decisions of others in your group.</li>

<li>Each round consist of a 'messaging part' followed by a 'decision part'.</li>

<li>In the messsaging part, you may send individual messages to each of your friends to reveal your intention to participate or not, and your friends can do the same.</li>

<li>In the decision part, you can view the messages sent to you by your friends, and you must make your participation decision for the round. Once you submit your decision, a new round will start. You will not observe the outcome of the rounds.</li>

<li>You will be paid for ONE randomly chosen round. You should pay careful attention to each round.</li>
